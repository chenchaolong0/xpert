 * Publishes all trigger nodes for a given xpert graph.

 * - This command carries only immutable input data and no execution logic.
 * - It allows trigger publication to be reused from different entry points
 *   (startup recovery, manual publish flow) through one CQRS handler.
 * - `previousGraph` enables the handler to stop old trigger subscriptions
 *   before publishing the new graph state.
